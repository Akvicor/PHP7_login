Run install.sql trough phpmyadmin, SQL tab on server, not any table or database.
Second way is directly trough MySQL server
Run locallly mail server, I used Mercury. It is based on locally sended emails, you can receive them with modded Thunderbird.
Change values in php.ini:
SMTP = localhost
smtp_port = 25
sendmail_from = postmaster@localhost
